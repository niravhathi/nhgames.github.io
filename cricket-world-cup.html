  <p>The Cricket World Cup is the premier international championship of One Day International (ODI) cricket, organized
    by the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC). It is one of the most widely watched
    sporting events in the world. <a href="#ref1">[1]</a></p>

  <h2>History and Format</h2>

  <p>The first Cricket World Cup was held in 1975 in England, with the West Indies emerging as the inaugural champions.
    The tournament initially featured 60 overs per side but was later reduced to 50 overs per side from the 1987 edition
    onwards. <a href="#ref1">[1]</a></p>

  <p>The Cricket World Cup is held every four years, with the hosting duties rotating among the leading cricketing
    nations. Many tournaments have been jointly hosted by countries from the same geographical region, such as South
    Asia, Australasia, Southern Africa, and the West Indies. <a href="#ref1">[1]</a></p>

  <p>The format of the tournament has evolved over time, with the number of participating teams varying from edition to
    edition. The 2023 Cricket World Cup in India featured 10 teams, while the 2027 edition in South Africa, Zimbabwe,
    and Namibia will have 14 teams.</p>

  <h2>Recent Tournaments</h2>

  <p>The 2023 Cricket World Cup in India was won by Australia, who defeated the hosts in the final at the Narendra Modi
    Stadium in Ahmedabad. It was Australia's sixth World Cup title, cementing their status as the most successful team
    in the tournament's history. <a href="#ref2">[2]</a><a href="#ref3">[3]</a><a href="#ref4">[4]</a><a
      href="#ref5">[5]</a></p>

  <p>The 2019 edition in England saw a dramatic final between the hosts and New Zealand, with the match tied after
    regular play and the subsequent Super Over. England was eventually crowned champions based on a higher boundary
    count, claiming their first-ever World Cup title. <a href="#ref4">[4]</a></p>

  <h2>Broadcast and Viewership</h2>

  <p>The Cricket World Cup enjoys immense popularity and viewership, particularly in the cricket-playing nations. The
    2023 edition in India broke broadcast and digital records, with the final attracting a staggering global audience of
    over 1.5 billion viewers. <a href="#ref2">[2]</a><a href="#ref3">[3]</a></p>

  <h2>Future Hosts</h2>

  <p>The ICC has announced the hosts for the upcoming Cricket World Cup tournaments. The 2027 edition will be jointly
    hosted by South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Namibia, while the 2031 tournament will be held in India and Pakistan. <a
      href="#ref1">[1]</a></p>

  <p>In conclusion, the Cricket World Cup is the pinnacle of ODI cricket, showcasing the best teams and players from
    around the world. Its rich history, intense rivalries, and global appeal make it one of the most anticipated and
